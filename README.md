# STM32WBA-BLE-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring

* The STM32WBA-BLE-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring demonstrating Bluetooth速 SIG [Continuous Glucose Monitoring Profile 1.0.2](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/cgmp-1-0-2/) example, based on STM32CubeWBA V1.3.1
 
## Hardware Needed

  * This example runs on STM32WBAxx devices.
  * Connect the Nucleo Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B to ST-LINK connector (USB_STLINK). 

## User's Guide

1) Run this Bluetooth速 Low Energy Continuous Glucose Monitoring project where the STM32WBA will advertise

2) Use the ANDROID/IOS ST BLE Sensor application or ST BLE Toolbox application to connect with this Bluetooth速 Low Energy [Continuous Glucose Monitoring Profile 1.0.2](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/cgmp-1-0-2/) (CGM_XX where XX is the 2 last digit of the Bluetooth速 Device Address)
  
   Scan on ANDROID/IOS:
